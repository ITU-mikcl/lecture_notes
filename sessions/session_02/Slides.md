# **Analysis, Design and Software Architecture (BDSA)**
Session 2
[Helge Pfeiffer](ropf@itu.dk)


## Plan for today

- First hour: Working together on software projects (Branching strategies)
- Second hour: Working together on software projects (on GitHub)
- Third hour: Building Software
- Fourth hour: Design review and refactoring

<!-- First hour -->

## Feedback

- From the currently registered 29 groups, only **one** group  did not create an organization on GitHub?
- Two more have not created/do not use a public repository called `Chirp` in their organization yet.
  - Please fix that! Remember to work continuously on your projects.


## Feedback

Currently, **15** of you are not registered in a project group, i.e., ca. 10% of the participants of this course.

Remember, you cannot pass this course without passing the project on which you work in a group.

## Feedback III

- 🗸 One co-author per line in form `name <emailaddress>`
  ```

</a>
</font>


## Feedback IV

How do I read the slides that you are presenting?

* Once, create a copy of the lecture note repository: `git clone git@github.com:itu-bdsa/lecture_notes.git`
* Switch to the directory that contains the repository that you just cloned: `cd path/to/lecture_notes`
* Switch to the directory of the session that you want to read: `cd sessions/session_02`
* Open the HTML slides in your browser: `xdg-open Slides.html` (Linux), `open Slides.html` (MacOS), Windows??? (click on it in the file explorer or you have to figure it out, depending on the shell you are using, see e.g., https://superuser.com/questions/246825/open-file-from-the-command-line-on-windows)


## Feedback V: Paths? Commands?? Terminal???

<style scoped>
section {
  font-size: 20px;
}
</style>

* On Linux/Unix operating systems, you have one root directory: `/`
* Below that, you have nested directories, e.g., `/tmp` a directory for temporary files and data.
* Paths can be specified absolutely (from root): `/tmp/` or relatively from the present working directory, e.g., `../another/dir`, which means one directory above my present working directory, there is a directory called `another`, which contains a directory called `dir`.
* A single dot `.` represents the present working directory.
* Typically, a user has a _home_ directory, which is usually stored in an environment variable `HOME`.
  * Print it out, e.g., with `echo $HOME`. For me it is: `/home/ropf`
  * The tilde sign (`~`) is expanded to your _home_ directory path, e.g., for me `/home/ropf` and `~` are the same.

* Identify the present working directory with the `pwd` command
* List the contents of a directory with the `ls` command `ls path/to/dir`
* Create a directory: `mkdir /tmp/test_dir`
* Change to another director: `cd /tmp/test_dir`
* Create an empty file in a directory: `touch IDatabaseRepository.cs`


## Feedback VI: Code Review

    string inputString = string.Join(" ", args.Skip(1).ToArray());
    writeToFile(inputString);
}

static void readFile()
{
    //Pass the file path and file name to the StreamReader constructor
    StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("./chirp_cli_db.csv");
    //Read the first line of text
    String line = sr.ReadLine();
    //Continue to read until you reach end of file
    while (line != null)

        string user = line.Substring(0, firstCommaIndex);
        string message = line.Substring(firstCommaIndex + 1, lastCommaIndex - firstCommaIndex - 1).Replace("\"","");
        string unixTime = line.Substring(lastCommaIndex + 1);

        //Converts string from file to int
        int i = 0;
        int.TryParse(unixTime, out i);
        string timeInDate = (UnixToDate(i));

## Process: Working together via Git Repositories

* **Centralized Workflow**

  </font>


## Process: Working together via Git Repositories on GitHub

One GitHub specific implementation of the Integration-Manager Workflow is The GitHub Flow:

  > 1. Fork the project.
  > 2. Create a topic branch from `main` (or any other indicated branch).
  > 3. Make some commits to improve the project.
  > 4. Push this branch to your GitHub project.
  > 5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
  > 6. Discuss, and optionally continue committing.
  > 7. The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.
  > 8. Sync the updated master back to your fork. <font size=3>

## Process: Working together via Git Repositories on GitHub

In your projects, you decide which of the two workflows you choose, i.e., Centralized Workflow or Integration-Manager Workflow.

To start with, it is likely most easy to stick to the Centralized Workflow.

## Trunk-based Development

  > A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’, **resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches** by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.

<font size=3>

</font>

  > ... trunk-based development, where each developer divides their own work into small batches and merges that work into trunk at least once (and potentially several times) a day. The key difference between [feature branches and trunk-based development] is scope. Feature branches typically involve multiple developers and take days or even weeks of work. In contrast, branches in trunk-based development typically last no more than a few hours, with many developers merging their individual changes into trunk frequently.

## Process: Make work visible

One problem with software and its development, it is and intagible and invisible artifact.

That means, we do not know how far we are in its construction and how much work there is left to its completion.

In physical engineering projects that is more easily accessed.

Solution for us software engineers: make work visible via suitable project planning tools.

## Process: Organizing work on GitHub with Issues

Despite the name, an issue usually describes a _requirement_ to a software system, for us, a unit of work. Often such issues are called _tickets_. They can describe _new features_, _bugs_, nice to have _enhancements_, etc.


Note, an issue tracker is a general tool. Here, GitHub issues is just used as example. One may rely on other systems, such as, [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/jira) or even just paper →

Describe User Stories.
![bg right:40% 130%](https://blog.zenhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/submit-issues.webp)

  > the common structure for a user story addresses the “who, what, and why” of a feature:
  >
  > As a (user type), I want to (task) so that (goal).
  > ...
  > We suggest sticking that user story in the issue’s title.
  >
  > The point is to make the GitHub issue well-defined for everyone involved: it identifies **the audience** (or user), **the action** (or task), and **the outcome** (or goal) as simply as possible.

No matter which template you use, let the user story be followed by an _acceptance criteria_.

For example:

    As a user, I can log in through a third-party account.

    Acceptance criteria:
      * Can log in through Microsoft
      * Can log in through Google
      * Can log in through GitHub


## Writing _Good_ Issues

  >    is negotiable, meaning there are usually several ways to get to the stated goal.
  >    is small and easily estimable in terms of time and resources required.
  >    is measurable; you can test for results.

## Writing _Good_ Issues

Use the _INVEST_ acronym:

> * Independent: The User Story stands for itself and is independent of other stories.
> * Negotiable: The content is negotiable and is gradually described in more detail until it can be implemented.
> * Valuable: It is valuable and offers the user or customer an added value or benefit.
> * Estimable: The effort to realise it must be estimable by the developers.
> * Small: It is so small that it can be realised within one iteration or sprint.
> * Testable: It has acceptance criteria and can be tested.

With your neighbors, navigate to your groups repository and create an issue (use the link with your group number `<no>` replaced `https://github.com/ITU-BDSA2024-GROUP<no>/Chirp/issues/new/choose`)
Choose one of the tasks of this week's project work and describe it in an issue, e.g., choose [task 2.d)](./README_PROJECT.md#2d-refactor-chirpclis-programcs-to-use-an-external-library-cli-interface).

- Use the user story template `In order to <receive benefit> as a <role>, I can <goal/desire>`.
- Write a suitable acceptance criteria.
- Is the issue you describe a _feature_, a _bug_, an _enhancement_ or something else? Label it accordingly.
- Once done, post a link to your issue in our Teams chat so that we can discuss some examples.


## Collaboration; How to Work Together?

![bg right:50% 100%](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-167219/mw-1440/images/help/projects-v2/example-board.webp)

With work explicitely described in issues, it is clear _what_ you have to work on. But it is not clear which work tasks are more important than others, which are currently worked on, which are already completed, etc.

Consequently, software projects use often some form of project board to make the status of a project visible.

- Call the project `ITU-BDSA2024-GROUP<no> Chirp`, where `<no>` is your group's number.
- Choose to create a project board from the `Team backlog` project template (to the left).
- Add the issues that you already have in your repository, e.g., the one from the previous task by clicking the command palette (`>_` icon on the top) followed by `Add items`

## Building .NET Projects

So far, you likely invoked your programs via `dotnet run` in your project folder.
That command calls internally `dotnet build`, the actual build step.

* Why does it matter how to build software?
* What is software?

    > Software is the collection of **all artifacts**, which allow (a) **suitably educated person(s)** with access to specified and suitable **hardware** to **instantiate** a running system.
    >
    > Additionally, the collection of such artifacts allow such suitably educated person(s) to **understand** and **reason** about a systems' working and properties and let them **understand** why the system is as it is and why it behaves the way it does.
    <font size=3>Source: Helge</font>

  That is, software is first software once it can be **executed** (instantiated). To be able to run software you have to first build (and distribute) it.


## Task: Download and run a program

I have built a program for you. Download it from here: [`hello.zip`](./hello.zip).

In a terminal, decompress the downloaded ZIP file, and run the program via the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
unzip hello.zip
./hello
```

Can you actually run the program?

- If yes, what do you see?
- If not, what do you see?

- Navigate to the .NET/C♯ project in today's lecture notes [`bdsa_greeter`](./bdsa_greeter)
- There (`cd bdsa_greeter`), build the project with `dotnet build`, and inspect the results of the build with `ls -ltrh bin/Debug/net7.0/`.
- Now, run `dotnet publish`, and compare the results in `ls -ltrh bin/Release/net7.0/<RID>/publish` to the results of the build step `ls -ltrh bin/Debug/net7.0/`
  - Replace `<RID>` with either `win-x64`, `osx-64`, `osx-arm64`, or `linux-x64` depending on your operating system.
  - What do you see in the `publish` directory?
- Now, toggle the `PublishSingleFile` property of the project file [`bdsa_greeter.csproj`](./bdsa_greeter/bdsa_greeter.csproj) to false, i.e., line 10 becomes `<PublishSingleFile>false</PublishSingleFile>`
  - Run `dotnet publish` again, and compare its results in `ls -ltrh bin/Release/net7.0/publish/` with the previous results.
  - What happens when you run `dotnet bin/Release/net7.0/publish/hello.dll`?
- Lastly, toggle the `SelfContained` property of the project file [`bdsa_greeter.csproj`](./bdsa_greeter/bdsa_greeter.csproj) to true, i.e., line 11 becomes `<SelfContained>true</SelfContained>`
  - Run `dotnet publish` again, and compare its results in `ls -ltrh bin/Release/net7.0/<RID>/publish` with the previous results.

Describe to each other what you are seeing in the different publishing steps.

### How to build .NET software?

  > Applications you create with .NET can be published in two different modes, and the mode affects how a user runs your app.
  >
  > Publishing your app as **self-contained** produces an **application that includes the .NET runtime and libraries**, and your application and its dependencies. Users of the application can run it on a machine that doesn't have the .NET runtime installed.
  >
  > Publishing your app as **framework-dependent** produces an **application that includes only your application itself and its dependencies**. Users of the application have to separately install the .NET runtime.

### How to build .Net software?


  > `dotnet publish` compiles the application, reads through its dependencies specified in the project file, and publishes the resulting set of files to a directory. The output includes the following assets:
  >
  >  * Intermediate Language (IL) code in an assembly with a `dll` extension.
  >  * A .deps.json file that includes all of the dependencies of the project.
  >  * A .runtimeconfig.json file that specifies the shared runtime that the application expects, as well as other configuration options for the runtime (for example, garbage collection type).
  >  * The application's dependencies, which are copied from the NuGet cache into the output folder.
  >
  > Publishing an app as framework-dependent produces a cross-platform binary as a `dll` file, and a platform-specific executable that targets your current platform. The `dll` is cross-platform while the executable isn't.

### Dynamically linked binaries

The .NET compiler creates dynamically linked binaries as the previous example illustrates.

Other languages that you know of, e.g., Go, create statically linked binaries.

### "Fat" statically linked binaries

Does a statically linked binary (single file applications) actually contain everything we need to run a program?

No, not necessarily. But languages like Go support you in building "Fat" statically linked binaries. These are binaries that also include all static artifacts that a program may need during execution.

```go
import _ "embed"

//go:embed hello.txt
var s string
print(s)
```

<font size=3>
Source: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/embed">Official documentation</a> and <a href="http://www.inanzzz.com/index.php/post/1rwm/including-and-reading-static-files-with-embed-directive-at-compile-time-in-golang">a blog post on that topic</a>

So far, I believe, .NET does not support such a build feature.



## Intro to `make` and `Makefile`s

Usually, building software requires multiple commands that have to be executed in a correct order to build the final binaries that can be deployed.
These commands and their order have to be remembered...
Since building software is actually quite difficult, build systems were invented.

These in turn are [usually also quite difficult](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf).


## Intro to `make` and `Makefile`s

One of the oldest and most widely build tools is the `make` tool.


  > Make originated with a visit from Steve Johnson (author of yacc, etc.), storming into my office, cursing the Fates that had caused him to waste a morning debugging a correct program (bug had been fixed, file hadn't been compiled, cc *.o was therefore unaffected). As I had spent a part of the previous evening coping with the same disaster on a project I was working on, the idea of a tool to solve it came up. It began with an elaborate idea of a dependency analyzer, boiled down to something much simpler, and turned into Make that weekend. Use of tools that were still wet was part of the culture. Makefiles were text files, not magically encoded binaries, because that was the Unix ethos: printable, debuggable, understandable stuff.

Let's investigate a `Makefile`  for the previous example [.NET project `Makefile`](bdsa_greeter/Makefile)

## Parsing CLI arguments and options

Last session, you have seen how to extract command line arguments and options that are passed to your program on invocation from the `args[]` property.

CLI APIs get quickly complicated, so parsing this information manually becomes quickly cumbersome and error prone. Additionally, the API of how to invoke a program is part of documentation too.

---
### Example: Parsing CLI arguments and options with `docopt.net`

```csharp
const string usage = @"Chirp CLI version.

Usage:
  chirp read <limit>
  chirp cheep <message>
  chirp (-h | --help)
  chirp --version

Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen.
  --version     Show version.
";

var arguments = new Docopt().Apply(usage, args, version: "1.0", exit: true)!;
```


To make this example work, you have to install the `docopt.net` library, a third-party dependency into your project, e.g., via `dotnet add package docopt.net`.


## Design: Review of your current _Chirp!_ systems

<!--

- So far the design of your _Chirp!_ applications is as simple as it can get:
  ![](images/within_pkg_dep.png)
  - One package contains the all the code in one single class, likely with two methods
  - Note the above is illustrated as an [UML Package diagram](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/package-diagrams-overview.html) combined with a [UML class diagram](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams-overview.html). A package in .NET terms is a _project_

* What is good about this design and what could be improved/changed?

@Helge: illustrate that on Chirp example code from session 1.


## Task: Identify potential refactorings

<!--

We realize that storing and retrieving data to/from a CSV file is a generally useful feature that we might want to use independently of _Chirp!_.

Sketch a potential refactoring of the source code of your current _Chirp!_ CLI tool that would allow to reuse a CSV file-based database in other applications too.


## Design: Refactor the design of your current _Chirp!_ systems

</style>

We realize that our current implementation is tightly coupled to our _Chirp!_ CLI tools. This coupling is two-dimensional:

  1. Reading and writing of CSV files has to be factored out of the _Chirp!_ CLI tools.
  2. Reading and writing of other data than `cheeps` should be supported to be generally useful

@Helge: illustrate that on Chirp example code!

* Therefore, in your project work, you will refactor the "database" engine of _Chirp!_ so that it looks as in the following
     ![](images/accross_pkg_dep.png)


## The World's Simplest Database

Actually, in last week's project work, you built a database that is similar to _"the world's simplest database"_:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
db_set () {
    echo "$1,$2" >> database
}
db_get () {
    grep "^$1," database | sed -e "s/^$1,//" | tail -n 1
}
```

```
$ db_set 123456 '{"name":"London","attractions":["Big Ben","London Eye"]}'
$ db_set 42 '{"name":"San Francisco","attractions":["Golden Gate Bridge"]}'
$ db_get 42
```

## Task: Understanding Generics in C♯

What is the meaning and purpose of `T` in that interface? Discuss with your neighbors.

```csharp
namespace SimpleDB;

public interface IDatabaseRepository<T>
{
    public IEnumerable<T> Read(int? limit = null);
    public void Store(T record);
}
```

Hint: Think about a client program, i.e., a program that uses `SimpleDB` for persistence, where a client `Program.cs` could contain the following:


```csharp
IDatabaseRepository<Cheep> database = new CSVDatabase<Cheep>();
...
var cheep = new Cheep("Helge", "Hej!", DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeSeconds()
database.Store(cheep);
...
public record Cheep(string Author, string Message, long Timestamp);
```



## Design: Depend on Abstractions

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #deb887, #d17e12)"
_color: white
-->

The general concern of storing and retrieving data is independent of the underlying technology.
In future, we might decide that our data should not be stored in CSV files anymore but instead in a relational, document-oriented, etc. database
Consequently, we create an interface that specifies the generic concern of retrieving and storing data.


```csharp
namespace SimpleDB;

interface IDatabaseRepository<T>
{
    public IEnumerable<T> Read(int? limit = null);
    public void Store(T record);
}
```

## Task: Create a library project

<!--
_backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to bottom, #67b8e3, #0288d1)"
_color: white
_header: 5 minutes
-->

We realize that storing and retrieving data is something that is a separate concern that should be implemented independently from the _Chirp!_ application.

Therefore, in your project work, you will have to create a new library project that implements everything related to persisting data to and retrieving data from CSV files.

- Create a new library project: `dotnet new classlib -n SimpleDB`
- In it create a file `IDatabaseRepository.cs`, e.g., via `touch IDatabaseRepository.cs`
- Place the code from the previous task in it:
  ```csharp
  namespace SimpleDB;

  interface IDatabaseRepository<T>
  {
      public IEnumerable<T> Read(int? limit = null);
      public void Store(T record);
  }
  ```
